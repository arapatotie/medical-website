                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p><strong>21 May 2025 — News release</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines, in collaboration with the Department of Health (DOH) and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), convenes the End-of-Project Conference for the Strengthening Health Care Provider Network with Enhanced Linkage to Community for Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCAH) initiative, otherwise known as Subnational Initiative (SNI) Phase 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SNI Phase 2 supports communities in developing effective approaches to delivering essential services for mothers, newborns, and adolescents. The initiative strengthens governance and management to enhance the responsiveness of Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs), ensuring effective coordination among healthcare providers—from barangay health stations to hospitals, in both public and private settings. SNI Phase 2 also focuses on sustaining and scaling up gains from the initial implementation of the initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now in its final phase of implementation, the conference serves as a culminating platform to showcase the initiative’s significant achievements, best practices, and lessons learned over the past five years. Implemented in partnership with the DOH Centers for Health Development in Caraga, Davao, and Western Visayas, and supported by KOICA, SNI Phase 2 aims to strengthen health systems and improve service delivery for mothers, newborns, and adolescents in targeted regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Featuring a photo exhibit, field success stories, and technical sessions with experts from WHO, DOH, and KOICA—as well as participants from Caraga, Davao, and Western Visayas—the conference offers a comprehensive review of the initiative’s progress and development since the midterm conference on 24 August 2023. It also explores strategies for sustainability and scale-up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It is our sincere hope that the efforts and impact made—particularly in reducing maternal and infant deaths—will be sustained in our project sites: Aklan, Agusan del Sur, and the Davao Region. Furthermore, KOICA envisions that, in the bigger picture, we will be able to scale up at the national level,” said Ms Hyung Won Lee, KOICA Assistant Country Director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The Department of Health has always believed that the strength of our health system lies in our partnerships—with local governments, communities, and development allies like WHO and KOICA. Through SNI Phase 2, these partnerships became even more tangible,” said Dr Teodoro J. Herbosa, Secretary of Health. “We built on the successes of the first phase, expanded our reach, deepened our systems, and brought services closer to where they are most needed.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The success of the Subnational Initiative reflects the power of partnerships and community engagement,” said Dr Rui Paulo de Jesus, WHO Representative to the Philippines. “By strengthening local health systems and listening to the voices of those most affected, we have collectively laid the foundation for more resilient, inclusive, and people‑centred health care across the country.”
