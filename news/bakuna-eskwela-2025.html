                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> 
                    <strong>MANILA, 07 October 2024</strong> – The Department of Education (DepEd) and the Department of Health (DOH) launched the revival of the School-Based Immunization (SBI) program, dubbed "Bakuna Eskwela", to protect students from life‑threatening vaccine‑preventable diseases (VPDs). Education Secretary Sonny Angara and Health Secretary Ted Herbosa led the kickoff event Monday at the Dr. A. Albert Elementary School in Manila.

                <p>
                    The Bakuna Eskwela campaign will be rolled out in selected public schools across various provinces from October to November 2024 after a four‑year suspension due to the COVID‑19 pandemic. Focusing on measles, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations, the program shifts back from community‑based immunizations to its original school‑based setup following the resumption of in‑person classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Education Secretary Angara thanked President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. for his support. With a total budget allocation of PhP 853 million, Bakuna Eskwela aims to immunize at least 3.8 million public school students in Grades 1 and 7 with MR and Td vaccines, and another 973,930 female Grade 4 students in selected public schools for the HPV vaccine. "Sa bakuna, we can ensure our learners stay in school and don’t miss valuable learning opportunities," Sec. Angara said, noting studies showing some schools lost as much as 53 days of instruction in a single school year due to health‑related issues.

                <p>
                    "Our goal is to create a safe environment and ensure the health and well‑being of every Filipino child," Sec. Herbosa added, urging a united campaign with DepEd to protect children from VPDs.

                    <strong>MANILA</strong> – The Department of Health (DOH) on Monday reported a 25-percent decline in influenza-like illness (ILI) cases nationwide over the past two weeks, as the country continued to experience its seasonal rise in flu infections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a Facebook post, the DOH noted that its latest surveillance record showed 6,457 cases of ILI from Sept. 28 to Oct. 11, 2025, a significant drop compared to 8,628 cases during the same period last year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the decrease, the agency reminded the public that the flu season is ongoing, from the rainy months of June through the transition to the northeast monsoon or “amihan.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    To further curb flu transmission, the DOH launched its health education drive <em>“Trangkaso Bye-Bye!”</em>, which highlights simple preventive habits such as proper handwashing, adequate rest, and eating nutritious food. Its key messages include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“Maghugas ng kamay, Trangkaso Bye-Bye!” (Wash your hands, goodbye flu!)</li>
                    <li>“Magpahinga sa bahay, Trangkaso Bye-Bye!” (Rest at home, goodbye flu!)</li>
                    <li>“Kumain ng prutas at gulay, Trangkaso Bye-Bye!” (Eat fruits and vegetables, goodbye flu!)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ILI is a respiratory illness caused by viruses such as Influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The DOH said the downward trend reflected improved public adherence to preventive health measures and urged continued vigilance through vaccination and early medical consultation. It assured the public that surveillance and coordination with local government units will continue to ensure timely detection and response to flu-related illnesses. (<strong>PNA</strong>)
